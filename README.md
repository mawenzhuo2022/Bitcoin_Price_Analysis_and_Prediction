# Bitcoin_Price_Analysis

Use data mining and machine learning tools and method to do bitcoin price analysis and forecast

Our group proposes to study the potential correlation between Bitcoin's price movement and the corresponding reception of Bitcoin on Twitter. We plan to utilize the Kaggle dataset of Twitter responses regarding a certain period of Bitcoin and align it with the historical data of the Bitcoin price movement. This project would try to analyze the correlation between bitcoin price and sentiment trend, the pattern of how the sentiment drives the bitcoin movement, and the transaction volume based on the short-term sentiment fluctuation. Moreover, we will also analyze the correlation between the usersâ€™ demographic features and their sentiment to get a broader image.
